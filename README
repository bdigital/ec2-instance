== ec2-instance

This is a small set of extensions for common uses of the amazon-ec2 gem.

It is intended to be used in processes which are running on actual ec2 instances.  It uses the Instance module and other functions in EC2::Base to extract useful information from the hashes returned and to provide useful actions.

== Example

With an instance of EC2::Base:

@ec2.launch_time
=> Returns a Time object with a value representing the time amazon says this instance launched.
