== ec2-instance

This is a small set of extensions for common uses of the amazon-ec2 gem.

It is intended to be used in processes which are running on actual ec2 instances.  It uses the Instance module and other functions in EC2::Base to extract useful information from the hashes returned and to provide useful actions.

It also includes the Instance class which is more convenient to work with than an elaborate hash, though perhaps not universally more convenient.

== Example

With an instance of EC2::Base:

@ec2.launch_time
=> Returns a Time object with a value representing the time amazon says this instance launched.

@ec2.active_instances
=> [#<AWS::EC2::Instancex:0x7fe49d65eeb8 @launch_time="2010-08-23T19:50:35.000Z", @instance_id="i-354b215f", @status="running">, #<AWS::EC2::Instancex:0x7fe49d65ebe8 @launch_time="2010-09-12T07:42:14.000Z", @instance_id="i-3fb69355", @status="running">]
